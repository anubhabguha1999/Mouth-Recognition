<h2> My Approach </h2>

<p> My approach to this program will be to use a pretrained model called "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" as it contains many pretrained Facial Landmark Detection </p>
<p> Next, I need to read the frame and then convert the frame to grayscale for facial landmark detection </p>
<p> Then I setup the filters and the red dots for the UpperLips and the Lower Lips </p>
<p> Then passed a contion that if the length exceeds more than 30 then it should apply the filter </p>
<p> At the last I implemented a "Quit" Structure where if the user presses 'c' then both the program and the terminal will close. </p>
